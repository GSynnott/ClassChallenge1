# Code Refactor Starter Code
# Class Challenge 1 

What was the motivation?
The motivation here was to create a webpage that is accessible. It was also to learn to combine css code and see how it interacts with HTML.

Why did you build this project?
This was the first project for the UofT coding bootcamp scs course. It was designed to teach how to use semantic HTML elements for a more accessible webpage and learn how the css style sheet interacts with the HTML code.

What problem did it solve?
This solved the problem of a webpage having non-accessible code as in using non-semantic arguments. It also solves over complicating the css code with too many classes that do the same thing.

What did you learn?
I learned how to use semantic elements instead of non-semantic elements in order to create a more accessible webpage. I learned how to combine css classes that do the same thing in order to reduce the amount code and make it less complicated.
